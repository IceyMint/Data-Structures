# Extra Data Structures

Here you'll find a random assortment of interesting data structure implementations in Python. These are by no means complete, they're simply here for those who wish to look at some examples of data structures that aren't included as part of the Data Structures curriculum, but are interesting nonetheless.

If you'd like to contribute your own implementation of a data structure you find interesting, feel free to submit a PR :smile:
